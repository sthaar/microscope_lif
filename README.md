microscope_lif
notebook for reading LIF files produced by Leica-SPE-II
using readlif https://pypi.org/project/readlif/

not elegant and work in progress!
I'm sure there are better alternatives

but so far it works to
-read and display greyscale image for each channel separately
-dislay a list of filenames

todo
-channel images with colour (preferably suitable for colourblind)
-merge channels with colour (preferably suitable for colourblind)
